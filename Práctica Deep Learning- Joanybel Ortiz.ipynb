MLP lo utilizamos para procesar nuestros datos numéricos y categóricos del dataset que previamente debemos limpiar, categorizar y normalizar. \n","- **2 Modelo Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** Para el procesado de imágenes. La CNN es un tipo de Red Neuronal Artificial con aprendizaje supervisado que procesa sus capas imitando al cortex visual del ojo humano para identificar distintas características en las entradas que en definitiva hacen que pueda identificar objetos y “ver”. En este notebook he realizado previamente la selección de 1000 imágenes, las he reescalado y normalizado para poder luego pasarlas por mi CNN que debe terminar en 1 neurona. La última línea la podemos dejar comentada para quedarnos con 4 neuronas y de esta forma poder concatenar con la MLP más adelante. \n","- **3 Modelo VGG16 (híbdrido)** Una estrategia para lidiar en redes neuronales profundas es usar redes previamente preentrenadas con bases de datos grandes y adaptarlas al problema de nuestro interés. Las razones que por la que usamos VGG16 son las siguientes:\n","\n","  - Tiene una arquitectura fácil de comprender y, en su caso, de implementar.\n","  - Logra un excelente resultado en la competencia ImageNet (ILSVRC-2014), entre el 96% y 97%.\n","  - Contienen relativamente pocas capas convolucionales: 13 capas convolucionales y 3 densas, de ahí que en sus nombre incluya el 16.\n","  - La red (modelo y pesos entrenados) esta diponible en Kera.\n","\n","Este modelo híbrido nos permitirá obtener resultados al unir los datos numéricos, categóricos e imágenes. Sería como el resultado que podrías obtener si unimos la MLP y la CNN.

obtendremos en los modelos.\n","- Al cambiar los optimizadores, la cantidad de neuronas, el batch size o el learning rate podemos obtener mejoras en nuestros modelos. La cantidad de épocas también es determinante. En caso de tener tiempo para la ejecusión podemos poner más épocas para probar resultados.\n","\n","En los 3 tipos de modelos (MLP, CNN y VGG16) se obtuvieron resultados buenos a pesar de la poca cantidad de datos que utilizamos. \n","- **Resultados**:\n","  - MLP: Modelo 1 Loss=0.0060\n","  - MLP: Modelo 2 Loss=0.0075\n","  - **MLP: Modelo 3 Loss=0.0026**\n","  - CNN: Modelo A Loss=0.0134\n","  - Modelo-VGG16  Loss=0.0059\n","\n","La cantidad de datos inicial no era tan grande sin embargo al realizar los modelos en los colabs se desconectaba la GPU y se llenaba la RAM, por lo que tuvimos que optar por estudiar solo 1000 muestras. \n","\n","Pude realizar los 3 modelos antes descritos pero por motivos de diferencia en las dimensiones y tiemplo no pude concatenar los modelos MLP (numéricos y categóricos) y CNN (imágenes)... Sin embargo el VGG16 híbrido si e individualmemte los resultados obtenidos son buenos, adicionalmente a esto pude observar el poder y capacidad que tiene el Deep Learning en comparación con el Machine Learning. \n","\n","\n","\n"]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"collapsed_sections":["X35VOx5F5ZsO"],"name":"Práctica Deep Learning- Joanybel Ortiz.ipynb","provenance":[],"authorship_tag":"ABX9TyOmHYqAJkdS/n6zqJwKZgbs"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
